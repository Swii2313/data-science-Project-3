# data-science-Project-3     #Title: "Insurance Amount Prediction using Decision Tree Regression with Outlier Handling"

Description:
Our data science project focuses on predicting the appropriate amount of insurance coverage a person should consider based on various features, including age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking status, and region. The dataset contains both categorical and qualitative data, making it necessary to preprocess the data appropriately. Additionally, the dataset contains outliers, which will be addressed using the IQR (Interquartile Range) ratio method. For this regression problem, we will utilize the Decision Tree Regressor model.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
We will gather a diverse dataset from reliable sources, including features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, along with corresponding insurance coverage amounts. Categorical data, such as sex, smoker, and region, will be one-hot encoded, while qualitative features like BMI will be left as continuous variables. To handle outliers, we will calculate the IQR for each numerical feature and remove data points that fall outside the IQR range.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA will be performed to understand the distribution and relationships between the features and the insurance amount. Visualizations and statistical analyses will be used to identify patterns and correlations that could influence the model's predictive performance.

Feature Engineering:
During this stage, we may derive additional features from existing ones to capture more meaningful information. For instance, we might create a new feature indicating whether a person has any children or not, which could influence the insurance amount.

Model Selection:
Given the regression nature of the problem, we will employ the Decision Tree Regressor model. Decision trees are particularly effective for handling both numerical and categorical features, making them suitable for this dataset.

Model Training and Evaluation:
The dataset will be split into training and testing sets, and the Decision Tree Regressor model will be trained on the training data. To evaluate the model's performance, we will use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to measure how well the model predicts the insurance amounts on the test set.

Deployment and Communication:
The final trained Decision Tree Regressor model will be deployed into a user-friendly application, enabling users to input their relevant information (age, sex, BMI, etc.) and receive a predicted insurance amount. We will communicate the results effectively, along with any model limitations, emphasizing that the prediction serves as a guideline and that consulting with insurance professionals is essential for making informed decisions.

In conclusion, this data science project will build a robust Decision Tree Regression model to predict suitable insurance coverage amounts based on various features. By handling outliers, considering categorical and qualitative data, and interpreting the model's decisions, we aim to provide valuable insights for individuals seeking appropriate insurance coverage for their specific circumstances.
